## Bachelor_Thesis PLC Based Automatic Wire Stirrup Bender
The report, titled “PLC Based Automatic Wire Stirrup Bender” follows and expands on the 
eponymous Final Year Project carried out by a group of three students from Electronics 
Engineering department, Batch Spring 2015. For demonstration depends on “PLC Based 
Automatic Wire Stirrup Bender”. Its operation can be divided into three parts:
1. Feeding
2. Bending 
3. Cutting
4. PLC controller System
5. HMI
There a lots of shapes like simple shapes, sensitive’s shapes and complex shapes. Hence to get the 
proper shapes and nonstop monitoring and checking is necessary. In this project are create different 
types of shapes. The measurement of shapes are very difficult but our project resolve the 
measurement of the shapes. In this project you get a different types of shapes in seconds. There 
are various types of monitoring and controlling. . In this project, the method adopted is with the 
help of PLC .Here the various factors are monitored using sensors and PLC. The HMI use for 
selecting the shapes.

## Introduction
The automation of this process obliges to replace the manual human operations 
previously used to create a shapes .The sub systems are: 
1. Feeding System
2. Detection system
3. Bending system 
4. Cutting system
# Motivation
In industries it is a great straight forward of designing automatic panels for various machines and 
it is quite beneficial for engineers for having knowledge of such work. We have practiced that 
many automatic panels are designed on PLC’s and also on microcontrollers but for industrial 
application PLCs are most desirable. The common reason is because it’s much comfortable to 
program and install. They are appropriate in industrial environment like the continuous vibration 
and heat
# Problem Statement
Everything is Automatic for industrial use because they need secure and effective results. Industry
wants machines that can create more in short time to accomplish their goal in short time. For such
determination well-organized stirrup bender are designed to make machine easy to use and to 
collect fast result. Most of the machines are not that much well-organized than PLC based. There 
are various reason of PLC based provide fast speed, easy trouble shooting and correct result. Now, 
human machine interface makes the work rapid to the user to operate. It shows the encouragements
of the machine, user can change the factor related like change in size, change in design and many 
other. That’s why we have produced and practiced the PLC based Automatic Wire Stirrup Bender. 
# Organization of Thesis
This report documents the detail of “PLC based automatic wire stirrup bender. The suggested 
project is done by the FATEK-FBs series 20MAT2-ACand the result will show on HMI. The 
structures are applied on digital of the PLC as per requirement. This includes the application of 
some sensors and motors. It briefly defines the design and execution of the system. We are 
discussing all the key of our project in this report that is demanding in the construction industry, 
and primarily concentrating on the different types of shapes.
# Objective
The Main purpose of the project was to design a different types of shapes with the help of PLC 
and to control the measurement of wire in this project, various parameters are shown on HMI,
For complete understanding of the “PLC based Automatic Stirrup Bender” we first have to 
appreciate the base steps which are taken for this project. The overall process is divided into 
following phases:
3 Feeding
4 Bending
5 Cutting
In the first step the feeding is done by the stepper motor that feed the wire and the second phases bending the wire the bending process is adopted with the help of stepper motor and a shaft at last the cutting process is done with dc motor.

# Hardware and Instrumentation
Hardware contains of Motor, PLC and other mechanisms like push button, sensor and driver. 
Hardware connections can be seen below in figure 4.2 and 4.3 In this project sensor is used as 
metal detect device which detect the wire and motor is used to feeding ,bending of the wire and 
driver is used to drive the motor and at the end when shapes are made the dc motor is used as a 
cutting actuator.

# Conclusion
After all the work that has been accepted out during the project we have concluded that we have 
achieved the entire task given to us by the supervisor Engr. Muhammad Talha Iqrar and
co-supervisor Engr. Naveed-Ur-Rehman we have successfully fulfilled the design of “PLC Based 
Automatic Wire Stirrup Bender” by using PLC FATEK (FBs-20MAT2-AC), HMI Weintek 
(MT8000), Stepper Motor, sensors etc.
Our Project fixes all the working as said in the proposal as well in the report above. Different 
mechanisms of the system are calculated in such a way that is easily scalable with minimum 
efforts, so improvement can be done in upcoming extensions of the project easily
A Motor has been associated to the monitoring and control system with the help of various 
measuring components. Similar kind of work can be done with the help of Arduino and further 
corrective measures can also be taken care off while designing such systems. Other types of faults 
can also be considered such power factor problems ground faults.
# Recommendations for Future Work
Similar kind of work can be done with the help of DCS, Arduino etc. and further corrective 
measures can also be taken care off while designing such systems. Other types of faults can also 
be considered such power factor problems ground faults 
In future work, several changes can be made to improve the system and make it more reliable and 
powerful.
1. Advance Monitoring.
2. Better animation on HMI 
3. More Complex Shapes includes
4. Scanning System are includes
5. Use of IP cam for monitoring
